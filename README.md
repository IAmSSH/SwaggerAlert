# SwaggerAlert

## Description

Hi Beautiful People! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜Š

**SwaggerNotifier** works on top of SwaggerUI. SwaggerUI is used to generate documentation for APIs through annotations.

By default, SwaggerUI displays a list of APIs that are currently available. Therefore, there is no way for us to know which of them were deployed recently and which are the old ones.

SwaggerNotifier addresses this issue by adding the text `NEW!!!` besides newly created API services.

Here is how it works:

## Working

The first time you visit Swagger UI, expand your existing controllers to show all services like below:

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/RvvjQSf/old-list-copy.png" alt="old-list-copy" border="0">

And hit refresh. This will make SwaggerNotifier store the existing services.

Now, next time you visit this page, or refresh it, if there are any new deployments, they will be shown like this:

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/hmgD2N1/new-list-copy.png" alt="new-list-copy" border="0">

As simple as that ðŸ˜„

Happy Coding! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
